$ python masssms.py targetfile

You must create an accounts.txt file with at least 1 account to use, the target can be obtained at runtime

The linked accounts use basic starttls authentication via your SMTP server

Details on the nature of the accounts.txt and target file are present in the script

Note: Be careful with the mass emails/sms. They can be spam depending on your jurisdiction and use, and mail servers can filter them or contact your SMTP server based on how you use them.
